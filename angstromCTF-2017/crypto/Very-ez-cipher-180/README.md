**Description:**

> My friend Noah decided to build a cipher that would be unbreakable. Since he does not feel like trying very hard he made it a feistel network with a lot of rounds. Please retrieve the key used. An encryption service is running at web.angstromctf.com:1350. Code can be found [here](feistel.py).

> Hint: Too bad there are so many rounds
