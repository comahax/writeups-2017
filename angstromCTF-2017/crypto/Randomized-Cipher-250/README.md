**Description:**

> It appears that the random SP network is back! Same concept as last year with slight modifications to make it more interesting. Source code can be found [here](great_cipher.py). The flag will not be in actf{} format and will just be the key, hex-enocded. The server is running at web.angstromctf.com:1346.
>
> HINT: All S-boxes are equal, but some are more equal than others.
