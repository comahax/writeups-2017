**Category:** binary
**Points:** 50
**Solves:** 
**Description:**

> Our data input program was vulnerable to overflows, so we fixed that by implementing a circular buffer. Now it should be totally secure! See if you can prove us wrong and get the flag on our shell sever. The problem is available as: [binary](run_circles) and [source](run_circles.c).
>
> HINT: Think about all the conditions we might be in when reading data.
