# angstromctf 2017 : No libc for You

**Category:** binary
**Points:** 150
**Solves:** 
**Description:**

> Even ASLR and NX can't seem to stop you from exploiting all these buffer overflows. Rather than remove the buffer overflows, we decided to use static linking so you can't access libc anymore! Can you get the flag with no system() to help you out? Go ahead and give it a try on the shell server. The problem is available as: [binary](nolibc4u) and [source](nolibc4u.c).
