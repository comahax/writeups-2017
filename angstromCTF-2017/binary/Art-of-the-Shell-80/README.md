# angstromctf 2017 : Art of the Shell

**Category:** binary
**Points:** 80
**Solves:** 
**Description:**

> Looks like this program has a buffer overflow vulnerability! But there's no code inside that spawns a shell, so it must be secure! Get the flag anyway by exploiting it on our shell sever. The problem is available as: [binary](art_of_the_shell) and [source](art_of_the_shell.c).
>
> HINT: If the code isn't in the program, better write it yourself.
