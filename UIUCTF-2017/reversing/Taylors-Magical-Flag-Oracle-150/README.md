> By: Eric Hennenfent
>
> We set up a service to check if you've found the correct flag for this challenge. It'd take 1.7*10^147 years to brute force, so don't bother trying it.
>
> Note: flag follows the "flag{" format
>
> Update: Scores have been reset due to a bug that caused the flag to be printed without a legitimate solve. Scripts that solve the challenge in the intended way should still work.
